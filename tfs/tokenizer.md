In the context of tokenizers, particularly those from the Hugging Face library, a special_tokens_dict and a list serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a breakdown of their uses:

Special Tokens Dictionary
A special_tokens_dict is a dictionary that specifies special tokens and their associated roles within the tokenizer. For example, it defines tokens for the start of a sentence, end of a sentence, padding, and unknown tokens. The keys in this dictionary are typically predefined attributes that the tokenizer understands, such as 'bos_token', 'eos_token', 'pad_token', and 'unk_token'.

Here is an example of a special_tokens_dict:

python
Copy code
special_tokens_dict = {
    'bos_token': '<START>',
    'eos_token': '<END>',
    'pad_token': '<PAD>',
    'unk_token': '<UNK>',
    'sep_token': '<SEP>',
    'cls_token': '<CLS>',
    'mask_token': '<MASK>'
}
This dictionary is passed to the add_special_tokens() method to add these tokens to the tokenizer's vocabulary and inform the tokenizer of their special roles.

List of Special Tokens
A list of special tokens is typically just a collection of token strings without specifying their roles. It is often used when you simply want to add a set of tokens to the tokenizer's vocabulary without assigning them specific roles in the tokenizer's operations.

For example:

python
Copy code
special_tokens_list = ['<START>', '<END>', '<PAD>', '<UNK>', '<SEP>', '<CLS>', '<MASK>']
You might use a list like this with the add_tokens() method to add new tokens to the vocabulary:

python
Copy code
tokenizer.add_tokens(special_tokens_list)
In this case, the tokenizer will add these tokens to the vocabulary, but it won't know that they are meant to be used as start-of-sentence tokens or end-of-sentence tokens unless you specify this separately.

Conclusion
The choice between using a special_tokens_dict and a list depends on whether you need to assign specific roles to the tokens. If you're just expanding the vocabulary, a list is sufficient. However, if you need the tokenizer to recognize these tokens as having special functions during tokenization, then you should use a special_tokens_dict and appropriately inform the tokenizer of their roles. This is particularly important for tokens like <START>, <END>, and <PAD>, which affect how sequences are processed and handled in models.
